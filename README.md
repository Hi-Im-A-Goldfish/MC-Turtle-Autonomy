# MC-Turtle-Autonomy
## Info
Main files are in the JS/myproject,\n
Constructed with terrible programming and a varying will to live,
If you wanna run this, have fun uh success may vary widely depending on competency and how much I screwed up.
Half the files don't even do anything *don't ask me why, they just there*
## How to run
That's down to you
## What it is
literally just, button press, thing do thing, game go brrr, mod interact, websocket do more brrr, profit
